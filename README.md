## 🚀 How to Use This Template

This project can be used as a template for your own portfolio. To get the contact form working, you need to set up your own Formspree account.

1.  **Create a Formspree Account:** Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) and create a free account.
2.  **Create a New Form:** In your Formspree dashboard, create a new form. This will generate a unique endpoint URL for you (e.g., `https://formspree.io/f/your_unique_id`).
3.  **Update the `index.html` File:**
    * Open the `index.html` file.
    * Find the `<form>` tag within the "Contact Section."
    * Replace the `action` attribute's URL with your new Formspree endpoint.

    ```html
    <form class="contact-form" id="contact-form" action="YOUR_NEW_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT" method="POST">
    ```

    With this change, all form submissions will be sent to your email address instead of mine.
